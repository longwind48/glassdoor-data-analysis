You are curious about the stories that data can tell, and imaginative in communicating these stories in a simple, yet compelling manner that connects to the organisation’s strategy and goals. You are driven to build and execute learning analytics capabilities in CSC.
<br/><br/>
You work closely and creatively in a fast-paced, agile environment with stakeholders, from researching and applying data-driven approaches to anchoring data strategy (systems, technological solutions and processes); and making recommendations that are clearly linked to CSC’s strategy and priorities.
<br/><br/>
You are an intrapreneur, both practical and imaginative in problem-solving especially in emerging situations. You take full ownership of the entire data process from project scoping and management, data integration, data exploration and analysis to data visualisation. You are also methodical and have a healthy dose of scepticism of the value and limits of data.</div></div>"
